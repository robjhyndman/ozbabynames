\description{
The ozbabynames package provides the data object `ozbabynames` containing
popular Australian baby names by sex, state/territory and year. The coverage is very uneven,
with some states only providing very recent data, and some states only providing the top 50
or 100 names. The ACT do not provide counts, and so no ACT data are included.
South Australia has by far the best data, with full coverage of all names from 1944-2017
and 2024, although only the top 100 names in other years.
